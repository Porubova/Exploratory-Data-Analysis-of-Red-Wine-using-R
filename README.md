# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Red-Wine-using-R
Application of EDA techniques to explore relationships between different variable using R.

In this project, I  applied exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Dataset
This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

  This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez et al., 2009].
